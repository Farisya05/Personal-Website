            <h2>Kindergarten Era</h2>
            <p>My kindergarten years at Tadika Alpha were a memorable and foundational period in my life. It was where I first learned to navigate the world of education while having fun. From morning songs to storytelling sessions, every activity felt like an adventure. I learned the basics of reading, writing, and counting through interactive games and engaging lessons. Art projects and outdoor play sparked my creativity, while class performances helped me build confidence and overcome shyness. The friendships I made and the encouragement from my teachers created a supportive environment. These early experiences fostered my curiosity and laid the foundation for my learning journey.</p>

            <h2>Primary School Era</h2>
            <p>Primary school was a time of learning, growth, and building the foundation for my future. From ages 7 to 9, I attended Sekolah Kebangsaan Subang Bestari, where I began developing essential skills and exploring my interests. After moving to a new home, I transferred to Sekolah Kebangsaan Seri Pristana, where I studied until I was 12. While my primary school experience wasn't always exciting, it taught me resilience and discipline. The dedicated teachers played a crucial role in shaping my academic journey, imparting valuable lessons that remain with me today. Looking back, I appreciate those formative years as stepping stones to who I am now. </p>
