            <p>I have taken on several part-time jobs to gain experience and support myself financially. I used to work at Bakery shop named Chocolate Nine for five months while waiting for my first semestar to start in UiTM Rembau. Other than that, I also used to work as a kitchen helper at Academy Propandu's canteen during my second semestar break. In my free time, usually on weekend, I will help my father with grass cutting at the customers' house. </p>
